# time-ago

Utility to present time ago into a human-readable format.

## Sample Output

```js
// absolute time
fromToday(1) // 52 years ago

// dynamic time (in the past)
fromToday(new Date() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 7 days ago
fromToday(new Date() - 10 * 1000) // 10 seconds ago
fromToday(new Date()) // just now

// dynamic time (in the future)
// The util does NOT support future dates currently
fromToday(new Date() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // just now
```

## Worked Example

Let `initialTime` be 31 Jan 2021 at 12PM GMT+8, and let `today` be 31 Mar 2021 at 12PM GMT+8.

Converting into epoch,

- `initialEpoch` (ms) is `1612065600000`
- `todayEpoch` (ms) is `1617163200000`

Calculating `todayEpoch - initialEpoch` to obtain `timePassed`, we obtain `5097600000` (ms).

Note that

- `5097600000 < 31536000000` = year in ms
- `5097600000 > 2628000000` = month in ms

From here we can tell that the largest unit of time where the elapsed time is still more than the unit, is month.

Dividing `timePassed` by the number of milliseconds in a month,

- `5097600000 / 2628000000 â‰ˆ 1.9397`
- `Math.round(1.9397) = 2`

Now we can conclude that `initialTime` was 2 months prior to `today`.

The util then returns `"2 months ago"`.

## Caveats

- The util uses `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`, which only supports up to a smallest unit of seconds. For a time less than 1 second ago, the util returns `'just now'`.
- The util does not support future dates currently. For any date in the future, the util returns `'just now'`.
